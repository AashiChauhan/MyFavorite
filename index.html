    <p> My hobby is swimming. I have done swimming since I was 2 years old. When Summer comes, I always hang around the pool and swim. Swimming is a refreshment to me. I love spending time in the water. The deepest water I have ever swam to, was 12 feet. There are many strokes you have to learn in swimming such as butterfly, breaststroke, backstroke, and freestlye. They all are very fun but the best one I can do, is breaststroke.
